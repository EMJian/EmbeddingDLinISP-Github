	* scipy
	* matplotlib
	* pytorch
3. Run the file _generate\_G\_D.py_ to generate the required green's function matrices. Running this script might take a while. Go get yourself a cup of coffee
4. To start training the network, run the file _noisy\_data\_training.py_. Even this is going to take a few* hours.
5. You're ready to generate the results from scratch using the following files- 
	* _HomogenousAustria.py_
	* _HeterogenousAustria.py_
	* _LossyProfie.py_
	* _Compare\_with\_without\_DL.py_
6. One can view the saved results by running the file _results/viewResults\_Austria.py_.
